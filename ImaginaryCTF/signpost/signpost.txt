Description

Tracking down pictures can be hard. Surely you can't find where this giant ballpark is...

Submit your flag as ictf{latitude,longitude}, with the coordinates of where the picture was taken rounded to three decimal places. Example: ictf{-42.443,101.333}

closest location on the sign is seals stadium

after a google search it seems to be an old baseball stadium in San Francisco CA

I have been to Candlestick/ATT/Oracle Park (all the same park) so i have a bit of an upperhand 

Oracle park is about 2 miles from Seals stadium so the sign must be at oracle 

go to google maps and click to show coordinates

the sign is on the upper deck of centerfield by the marina

click on the post to get the coordinates

this gets us the flag

flag: ictf{37.778,-122.389}
