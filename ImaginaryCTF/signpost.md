## Challenge:

Tracking down pictures can be hard. Surely you can't find where this giant ballpark is...

Submit your flag as ictf{latitude,longitude}, with the coordinates of where the picture was taken rounded to three decimal places. Example: ictf{-42.443,101.333}

## Approach

Looking at the image, the closest location to the sign is seals stadium

After a google search seals stadium seems to be an old baseball stadium in San Francisco CA

I have been to Oracle Park so i have a bit of an upperhand 

Oracle park is about 2 miles from Seals stadium so the sign must be at oracle 

Go to google maps start looking at streetviews around the stadium

the sign is on the upper deck of centerfield overlooking the marina

click on the post to get the coordinates, and then round them to three places

this gets us the flag

flag: `ictf{37.778,-122.389}`
