## Challenge:

I found these suspicious files on my minecraft server and I think there's a flag in them. I'm not sure where though.
Note: you do not need minecraft to solve this challenge. Maybe reference the minecraft region file format wiki?


## Approach:

1. Use NBT Explorer
2. Use find on each mca file looking for flag format “amateursCTF{”
